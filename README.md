# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. The server provides an API for managing users and their data, including user creation, retrieval, and validation. The project also includes user authorization and error handling to ensure secure and reliable functionality.

## Deployed Project

**Domain:** https://wtwrapp.csproject.org

**Frontend Repository:** https://github.com/nortonrd3/se_project_react

## Project Functionality

- RESTful API for managing users.
- Endpoints for creating, retrieving, and managing user data.
- Error handling for validation, server errors, and resource not found.
- User authorization and authentication (to be implemented).
- Integration with a database for persistent data storage.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for creating RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB to manage data models.
- **ESLint**: For maintaining code quality and consistency.
- **Nodemon**: For hot-reloading during development.
- **Error Handling**: Custom error codes and messages for better debugging.
- **Testing**: Includes tests to validate API functionality.
- **Git**: Version control for tracking changes.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server.

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
